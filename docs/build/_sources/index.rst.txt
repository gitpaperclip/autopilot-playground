Autopilot Documentation
=======================

.. warning::
   This project is under current development. Be prepared if the docs
   change suddenly or something breaks.

Autopilot is a tool developed by FRC team 3414, designed to act as a powerful
solution for autonomous robot control.

Check out :doc:`about` to learn all the features of Autopilot and why it may
(or may not) be the solution for your team.

.. attention::
   This is currently a Java-only library.
   If your team uses C++, Autopilot is not available.
